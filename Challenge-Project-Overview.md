>
> We've pre-populated this Challenge Project Overview page — which is what will be shared with your Break Through Tech student team in August — using the details from your submission form. You should have received an email inviting you to join this repo as a Collaborator, enabling you to add files and make edits.
> 
> In order for your project to be finalized and assigned to a team, please:
> 1. **Review all sections below** and update or expand any content as needed, making sure to address the SME Feedback in the section immediately below. Look for square brackets to find the places below that require additional inputs from you (e.g., "About [Company / Org Name]").
> 2. **Add your dataset** to the [data folder](data) in this repo.
> 3. **Close the Issue assigned to you in this repo** to let us know that you have made your edits and the overview page is ready for final review. You can do this by going to the _Issues_ tab in the top left section of the menu above, add a comment that says "CA review complete", and click the button to Close the Issue.

## 📋 BTT Internal Evaluation Notes

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Python Compatibility | 🟡 | While the tech stack is predominantly Python, tools like LangChain and LangGraph may introduce additional complexity that requires careful integration and understanding from students. |
| Data Readiness | 🟡 | The status of data readiness is unclear; the actual size and structure of the datasets have not been disclosed, which could lead to data preparation challenges that need to be assessed at the start of the project. |
| Resource Check | 🟢 | No specialized hardware or proprietary software issues are identified in the submission. The tools indicated are available for student access. |

**Student Fit Score:** 5/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 7/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The proposed project is intriguing with the potential for significant practical applications in the field of AI and finance. However, clarity on data size and structure is essential for a successful student experience. I recommend refining the project scope to better fit the student's current capabilities while allowing for incremental learning.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
Build a deep agentic AI system using Openai-agents-sdk, or LangChain and LangGraph that autonomously search or scan the library of available ABS prospectus (downloadable from SEC website https://efts.sec.gov/EFTS/hits) — in order to identity potential risk defined by atypical or non-standard practice of clauses. E.g., user may search "is any ABS deal using the paper custody?", the agent is expected to search the document library, and list all the deals that using (or highly likely) using the paper custody.

### Success Criteria
1. Meet the key deliverables and millstones described below
2. The AI agent has decent performance (e.g., 70-80% user can get satisfying answers from the Bot)

### Project Milestones

Below is the key deliverables:
1. Data schema creation: downloading a good set of ABS deals' prospectus from the SEC, and prepare the indexing data schema (September)
2. AI Agent using openai-agents-sdk or LangChain and LangGraph: Multi-node state graph: Planner → Retriever/AI Searching → Reasoner → Evaluator → Reporter (October)
3. Build the user interface (testing and fine tuning the AI agent) (November)

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
